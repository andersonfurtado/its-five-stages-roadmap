## 📌 Overview

This repository contains all supplementary data and resources used in the study that analyzed 2,360 peer-reviewed articles on **Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)** published over 68 years. The work identifies:

- Thematic evolution and historical roadmap
- Most cited and relevant articles
- Distribution across Bloom’s learning domains
- Classification by academic fields using CNPq taxonomy
- Emerging trends and gaps (e.g., affective and psychomotor domains)
